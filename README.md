üîç Hand Gesture Recognition System
This project is a Python-based hand gesture recognition system using computer vision techniques. It captures real-time video input and detects specific hand gestures to trigger various actions. Ideal for applications in human-computer interaction, sign language interpretation, or gesture-based control systems.

Features:

-Real-time hand gesture detection using OpenCV and Mediapipe

-Custom gesture recognition logic

-Easy-to-understand code for educational and research purposes

-Expandable for additional gesture sets or ML-based classification

Tech Stack:

-Python

-OpenCV

-Mediapipe

Usage:

-Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

-Run the main script: python hand_gesture.py

-Show gestures in front of the webcam to see them recognized live
